## How to run
Program has been tested on Linux
1. Setup
* Make sure you have gecko driver installed: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
* Also, install TOR: https://www.torproject.org/download/ 
* Extract TorFolder in the `AutomatedSpearPhisher/Resources` directory
    * If you choose to use a different folder, you need to change the setting in the config.py file
2. Recommended step: use virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
4. Install dependencies 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

5. Run program
    `python3 ScrapeAppGUI.py`

## Troubleshooting
If you are running on a python version that doesn't have tkinter installed
please run 
```apt-get install python3-tk```

## Features
* Password protected program, so it will be easy to protect the program if we develop it further.
* Support for both Twitter and Facebook
* For the Facebook phisher, only the private phisher is working currently
    * The private Facebook supports a variety of browsers, make sure to download the appropriate selenium driver to use
    * The target is the user whose friends will be scraped, it can be your own username if you want to generate phishing messages for your friends
    * The number of friends parameter allows you to control how many friends you want to target. We recommend using a small number if you enable the posting option.
    * The path to the driver will the path to the Selenium driver
    * If you tick the check-box then the program will post to Facebook using your account
* For the Twitter portion, you just type the target's Twitter handle and the url to the phishing site. The program will output the Tweets. The generated tweets are stored in the `Output/tweets` directory. 

## Importance
Phishing attacks accounted for 80% of security incidents. And the pandemic has increased the number of cyber attacks. So, it is imperative that we study different social attacks. There is a more potent type of phishing called ‚Äúspear-phishing‚Äù, where an attacker gathers information about a user and uses that to craft a more persuasive message. This technique has a much higher click through rate than average phishing attacks. Fortunately, this method is time-consuming and so the attacker cannot target as many people. However, we believe that you can use machine learning to automate this process. If this process becomes widespread, it would have disastrous consequences.

Our project will be to create this automated spear-phishing tool. We will then use our tool to analyze them to determine the effectiveness of various algorithms and the vulnerability on different platforms. We also hope to show the potency of this attack. So, we will compare it to normal phishing attacks and compare the results. We hope the results from our study will help future developers and cybersecurity researchers to create more effective safeguards against social attacks.

Most malware comes from email. However, there is a rising trend for phishing attacks conducted on social media. This is because social media contains a plethora of personal information which makes it possible to launch this type of automated spear-phishing attack.

Rather than creating a defensive tool like a phishing detector using machine learning, we have created an offensive tool. This is because when people are trying to break things, they look for the easiest ways to get the job done. The principle of easiest penetration states that a security system is as strong as its weakest link. So by thinking like an attacker, we can become better defenders.
